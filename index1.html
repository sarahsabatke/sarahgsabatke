    <h1> <strong> Introduction </strong> </h1>

  <p> This site houses materials for training journalists to use automated writing (also referred to as branch writing and template writing) tools. This site was created in conjunction with the Associated Press. </p>



<p>Throughout these lessons, we will break down each aspect of automated writing and teach you how to incorporate this new skill to your daily responsibilities. </p>

<p>Automated writing, in a nutshell, involves programming a template within a specific software to interpret imported data. As a result, the data is placed into templates and comes out as automatically produced stories. These templates can be programmed for a variety of variables, including different word choices. They can also have the ability to recognize different types of data. </p>

<p><strong>What does this mean for you?</strong></p>

<p>The tool of automated writing allows you to write anywhere from a handful to hundreds of data-driven stories at once. User-created templates can be as simple or complex as desired in order to produce the end product. This not only enables you to produce more content for your audience but can also make it more feasible to track data and generate updates over an extended period of time. This means that, while automated writing can save time in the production process, it can also be used as a news gathering tool.  </p>

<p>For example, at the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/robots-wrote-this-story/">Washington Post, </a> the automated writing software can send notifications via Slack when things within datasets seem out of place or margins seem a little too wide. The program could be set to notify the newsroom of similar disparities or irregularities that could potentially turn into a bigger story. The automated writing software can also auto-generate updates on existing stories when new data is imported. For example, let’s say a bill that your  newsroom has been following moves to committee and there is a dataset that gets updated with that information. Within minutes, the newsroom also could automatically create a story about the update.
 </p>

<p>Overall, the user decides what metrics are important.  The automated writing tool is there to lend a helping hand in not only interpreting some of the data but also alerting the user to new findings. We will dive deeper into the newsgathering aspect a little later in this training. Hopefully, over the course of the next few lessons, you will feel encouraged to begin incorporating automated writing into your daily tasks.
 </p>

  <p><strong>Key Terms You Should Know:</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Template Writing/Branch Writing</strong></p>

  <p>Although we address this skill as automated writing, there are a few other terms that are often used as synonyms for “automated writing.” Most notably, these terms are “template writing” and “branch writing.” Moving forward in these lessons, you will see the tool referred to as “automated writing.” Beyond this training, you may see variations of all three terms — they can be used interchangeably, and the skill set needed to use them will remain the same. </p>


  <p><strong>If/Then statements</strong></p>

  <p>Otherwise known as “conditional statements.” When programming your template, there will be times where you will need to insert a “conditional” or an “if/then” statement. When the software filters through imported data, certain words or phrases will be triggered to appear depending on the conditional that is inputted. For example, if we create a conditional that says, “If the number is more than 80, then the student is above average,” then any number higher than 80 will trigger the phrase “above average” to appear in the automatically produced story. </p>

  <p><strong>Variables</strong></p>

  <p>Variables will be the items that change depending on what data is imported. Some common variables include temperature, city, date or time. These will be incorporated into the “if/then” statements as well. </p>
