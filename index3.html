<p> Great real-life example of how automated news writing can help you with breaking news. This also demonstrates how articles that are generated are living and breathing stories that can edited by multiple people in the newsroom as a story develops. </p>

<p>“Source is an <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-break-news-while-you-sleep/"> OpenNews project </a> designed to amplify the impact of journalism code and the community of developers, designers, journalists, and editors who make it.”</p>

<p>Reuters has been <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/03/reuters-new-automation-tool-wants-to-help-reporters-spot-the-hidden-stories-in-their-data-but-wont-take-their-jobs/">on the forefront </a> of automated news writing and has a number of articles that do a great job explaining how “Reuters wants to marry the data-crunching skills of machines with the editorial judgment of human reporters.”</p>

<p>“Reuters is building a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rpb-cyber/the-cybernetic-newsroom-horses-and-cars-idUSKCN1GO0Z0">“cybernetic newsroom” </a> – marrying the best of machine capability and human judgment to drive better journalism, rather than asking one to be a second-rate version of the other.”</p>

<p>Automated writing at Rueters from an outside perspective can be read <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/opinion/2018/04/05/inside-the-cybernetic-newsroom-where-reuters-robots-are-great-research-not">here</a>. </p>


<p>Automated writing is only the beginning. Google has already embarked on technology that is able to decipher between images and tag photos for Life magazine. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2018/03/07/googles-ai-scans-and-tags-millions-of-life-magazine-photos/">Learn more about it here</a>.	</p>


<p>Watson was able to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/2016/09/01/ibm-watson-movie-trailer-morgan/">use video recognition</a> to create a trailer for a movie. There has been tremendous progress from writing, to identifying photos, and now, digesting videos.</p>


<p>While AI is a great advancement in technology, sometimes it is not always used for good. Buzzfeed shows <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/obama-jordan-peele-deepfake-video-debunk-buzzfeed?utm_term=.oyB9kELWE#.tcQZp6Aj6">how “deep fakes” are created</a> and pose an issue in terms of trying decipher what is accurate and what isn’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://artsexperiments.withgoogle.com/lifetags/">This site</a> breaks down the process that Google’s algorithm went through to identify and archive the photos. </p>
